#SAS Project 1 Description
The DataSet used for the purpose of this project is a subset of the world commodity prices. Factor Analysis is used to determine the major commodity-specific groups in the global market.
1. There was no missing data in this DataSet which was validated using NMISS.
2. Standardization of the data was performed so that all the variables under evaluation are of same dimension. Hence, we standardize the dataset to have a zero mean and unit variance.
3. Factor Analysis without rotation
4. Factor Analysis using Orthogonal Rotation - VARIMAX & EQUAMAX
5. Factor Analysis using Oblique Rotation- PROMAX
6. Refer the Report for detailed analysis
